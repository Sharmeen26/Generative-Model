Generative Deep Neural Networks for Estimating Hypervariability in Hepatitis B and C Virus Genomes
This is the code for Deep learning LSTM generative model for predicting the hypervariable gene sequence of the HBV and HCV for the evolving genotype of each virus. 
The evolving nature of the Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, particularly in their hypervariable regions like the E2 gene for HCV, S1 and S2 genes for HBV, presents challenges in treatment and vaccine development. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) generative model for predicting evolving genotypes of HBV and HCV. By capturing sequential dependencies in viral sequences, this model aims to predict viral mutations, enhancing our understanding of viral evolution and supporting more effective antiviral strategies.
The comparison of LSTM model with the other models like Simple RNN and 1-dimensional Convolutional neural network were performed.
